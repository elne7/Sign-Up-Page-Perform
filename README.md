# sign_up_page_perform

Considering my last project the `Simple Shopping App`, This Task is a complement for the previous project

**Features:**

- Starts with a sign up page before entering the app.
- Displays a `ListView` widget to arrange the content vertically within the body.
- Displays 4 `TextFormField` widgets to insert the user information.
- Each textformfield has its spisific `Validator` to check if the inserted data is correct as required.
- Displays a `ElevatedButton` widget to submit the sign up when all the validators are correct.
- The elevatedbutton shows a `Dialog` widget says that the "Account Successfully Created".
- Also the dialog has a `TextButton` widget as it navigate the user to the shop app when pressing on it.

**Dependencies:**

* Uses the `Validators` package to control some validates on the text form field.

**Customised Widgets**
